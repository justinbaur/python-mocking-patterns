# python-mocking-patterns

Showcase different mocking patterns in python to help unit testing.

## Organizational Structures

### Script

Formal definition of this organizational structure from <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules>

> If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script

Keeping with the theme of simplicity, this example will use the most basic of configuration.

`venv` - Setup a virtual environment for segregating dependencies of this example
`requirements.txt` - Manage the dependencies for the example

### Module

Formal definition of this organizational structure from <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules>

> Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module.
